# f9-webrtc
An exploration of WebRTC

## Motivation

I want to create a testbed for various WebRTC functionality on a more _vanilla_ environment before I progress to investigating further the use of WebRTC with Cordova and (ionic).

## Requirements

I've a related Trello board at: [f9-webrtc](https://trello.com/b/Gbe5U7pc/f9-webrtc).

Requirements include:

- Setup sip server
- Use jssip
- Use CORDOVA/Ionic
- Test the jssip-cordova plugin
